# Current

Incomplete work for the next release milestone and active carry-over is listed
here. A completed milestone may remain until its release metadata is prepared;
its detailed pre-release history is retained in the
[delivery history](../reports/delivery-history.md); shipped versions are
recorded in the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md).

v0.10.0 shipped the MaterialX shader-generation boundary; its ownership rules
remain authoritative in the
[MaterialXGenSlang material boundary](../design/materialxgenslang-boundary.md).
v0.11.0 shipped the native Metal offscreen/residency backend; its objective,
compatibility, limitations, and evidence are recorded in
[docs/releases/v0.11.0.md](../releases/v0.11.0.md). v0.12.0 shipped native
Metal viewport presentation; its objective, compatibility, limitations, and
evidence are recorded in [docs/releases/v0.12.0.md](../releases/v0.12.0.md).
v0.13.0 shipped the HgiVulkan GPU-copy bridge; its release boundary is recorded
in [docs/releases/v0.13.0.md](../releases/v0.13.0.md).

## 🚧 v0.13.1 — HgiVulkan direct-path hardening

Consider same-logical-device sharing only after physical/logical device
identity, queue ownership, format/usage, public host consumption, completion
retention, resize/destruction, and vendor/driver evidence are all verified. GPU
copy remains the fallback. External memory/semaphores require a demonstrated
supported-host need and a measured advantage over GPU copy. The full contract,
forbidden synchronization, validation matrix, and dependency rules are in the
[Hgi host presentation policy](../design/hgi-host-presentation.md).

The direct-share gate and stable rejection telemetry are implemented. The
validated OpenUSD 26.05/26.08 public Hgi APIs create Hgi-owned textures and
alias Hgi-owned source textures, but do not import an existing Merlin-owned
`VkImage` into an `HgiTextureHandle`. Both local package builds and HgiVulkan
usdview smokes therefore report `public-texture-import-unavailable` and retain
GPU copy without color Map/upload or a coarse wait. Completion awaits the
self-hosted GPU capability workflow and reviewed release evidence; direct
sharing is not enabled merely to satisfy the milestone label.

## Active carry-over

### ⬜ v0.10.x — Development viewport and diagnostic surface

Turn `merlin-viewport` into the primary renderer-development and profiling
tool without turning it into a USD authoring application. Add a thin
immediate-mode UI integration, preferably Dear ImGui, behind a host abstraction;
the UI remains outside Core and renderer backends and consumes host-neutral
settings, diagnostics, capability, and telemetry contracts.

The initial surface covers:

- backend/device capabilities and the selected path or rejected fallback;
- CPU/GPU frame timings and AOV selection;
- geometry, texture, sampler, descriptor, and VRAM residency;
- material/module compilation state and structured diagnostics;
- primitive/instance counts, uploads, allocations, camera, and viewport state;
- screenshot and benchmark controls.

Exit requires the viewport to explain path selection and rejection, make
material/resource fallback visible without log inspection, and support
interactive performance-regression inspection. The Vulkan render loop remains
independent of UI frame rate and widget implementation. A complete stage tree,
property editor, and authoring workflow remain outside this milestone.

## Phase A foundation gates

These cross-cutting items should land alongside v0.10.x, before the
implementation becomes substantially more backend-specific.

### ⬜ Evidence-tier separation

- **Tier 1 — required hosted checks:** Core Debug/Release on Windows and Linux,
  shader compilation, SPIR-V validation/reflection, Metal-target compilation,
  MaterialX generation/ABI tests, install-tree consumers, and Hydra adapter
  compilation where a reproducible SDK is available.
- **Tier 2 — required or scheduled capability checks:** Vulkan runtime/image
  tests, Hydra discovery and first frame, native Vulkan viewport smoke tests,
  and stable-update/changed-range tests.
- **Tier 3 — hardware-profile evidence:** timing thresholds, bindless
  selection, transfer-queue behavior, VRAM pressure/exhaustion, and
  vendor-specific capability reports.

GPU timing does not become a universal pull-request gate until runner variance
is controlled; missing hardware evidence remains distinguishable from a product
failure.

### ⬜ Producer-session renderer evidence

`ost 0.21.0` retains the producer-session validation boundary and improves
managed configure recovery, but this repository has not yet produced a
successful managed renderer session on the current Windows host. CMake still
stops during the MSVC compiler ABI try-compile, so the complete renderer JSON
envelope and the binding between managed completion evidence and generated
renderer assertions remain unverified here.

Exit requires one successful managed `renderer view` or `renderer viewport`
session followed by `ost validate`, plus a negative check showing that stale
external renderer evidence cannot be promoted by a newer managed completion.
The current recheck and exact remaining evidence are recorded in
[OST report 11](../reports/ost/11-2026-07-29-v0.21.0-recheck-v0.22.0-asks.md).

### ⬜ Linux Vulkan validation

Add Linux Vulkan configuration and shader builds, useful headless execution
through Mesa lavapipe, optional real-GPU capability execution, and GLFW viewport
smoke coverage for supported window systems.

### ⬜ Versioned renderer settings

Define a host-neutral settings schema before DCC integration expands. The first
version covers backend, presentation mode, Forward/experimental path, AOV,
lighting mode, exposure/tone mapping, alpha policy, debug views, validation,
and telemetry controls.

## Near-term execution order

1. Keep the released v0.10.0 boundary narrow; do not broaden node coverage
   merely to claim general MaterialX. Production quality belongs to v0.18.0.
2. Add the development viewport surface over existing capability, timing,
   residency, upload, material, AOV, and fallback contracts.
3. Strengthen non-GPU and Linux gates before implementation breadth grows.
4. Preserve the completed native Metal presentation path while extending the
   shared viewport diagnostics and platform evidence.
